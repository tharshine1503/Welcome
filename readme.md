I used GitHub Copilot to help generate the initial version of the main script for this project. Copilot suggested several useful code snippets, including the function structure, input handling, and some logic for processing data. For example, when starting a new function, Copilot often auto-completed the function signature and provided a template for documenting the function.

Did you modify the script? If so, why?
Yes, I modified the script after Copilot’s initial suggestions. While Copilot was helpful for boilerplate and common patterns, I needed to:

Adjust variable names for clarity and consistency with project conventions.
Add error checking and input validation that was missing from Copilot’s suggestions.
Refactor some functions for better readability and performance.
Add comments and docstrings to improve maintainability.
These modifications were necessary to ensure the script worked correctly for my specific use case and to align with best coding practices.

How did you test it?
I tested the script by running it with various input cases, including edge cases. This involved:

Executing the script from the command line with different arguments.
Verifying that the output matched expected results.
Using print statements and assertions to check intermediate values.
Fixing any bugs or unexpected behavior discovered during testing.
How to Run the Script
Clone the repository (if you haven’t already):

bash
git clone https://github.com/tharshine1503/Welcome.git
cd Welcome
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed.
(List your dependencies here, for example:)

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or, if there are no dependencies, skip this step.
Run the script:
(Replace script.py with the actual script name.)

bash
python script.py
Follow any on-screen prompts or instructions.
(Add any further usage notes here, such as required arguments or input files.)
